abstract="Rigorous estimation of maximum floating-point round-off errors is an important capability central to many formal verification tools. Unfortunately, available techniques for this task often provide overestimates. Also, there are no available rigorous approaches that handle transcendental functions. We have developed a new approach called Symbolic Taylor Expansions that avoids this difficulty, and implemented a new tool called FPTaylor embodying this approach. Key to our approach is the use of rigorous global optimization, instead of the more familiar interval arithmetic, affine arithmetic, and/or SMT solvers. In addition to providing far tighter upper bounds of round-off error in a vast majority of cases, FPTaylor also emits analysis certificates in the form of HOL Light proofs. We release FPTaylor along with our benchmarks for evaluation.",

abstract="Finite precision computations can severely affect the accuracy of computed solutions. We present a static analysis, and a prototype implementing this analysis for C codes, for studying the propagation of rounding errors occurring at every intermediary step in floating-point computations. The analysis presented relies on abstract interpretation by interval values and series of interval error terms. Considering all errors possibly introduced by floating-point numbers, it aims at identifying the operations responsible for the main losses of accuracy. We believe this approach is for now specially appropriate for numerically simple programs which results must be verified, such as critical instrumentation software.",

abstract="Computers manipulate approximations of real numbers, called floating-point numbers. The calculations they make are accurate enough for most applications. Unfortunately, in some (catastrophic) situations, the floating-point operations lose so much precision that they quickly become irrelevant. In this article, we review some of the problems one can encounter, focussing on the IEEE754-1985 norm. We give a (sketch of a) semantics of its basic operations then abstract them (in the sense of abstract interpretation) to extract information about the possible loss of precision. The expected application is abstract debugging of software ranging from simple on-board systems (which use more and more on-the-shelf micro-processors with floating-point units) to scientific codes. The abstract analysis is demonstrated on simple examples and compared with related work.",

abstract="Polynomials are used in many applications and hidden in libraries such as libm. Whereas the accuracy of functions used by linear algebra have long been studied, little is available to decide on one scheme to evaluate polynomials. Common knowledge solely emphasizes that Horner's rule is a good scheme unless the indeterminate is close to one of the polynomial's roots. We propose here criteria for one step of Horner's scheme to be faithful. A result is defined to be faithful when it was correctly rounded whereas the rounding mode (up, down or to the nearest) cannot be known by users. Our criteria are validated with the IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic using Coq automatic proof checker. We also present three programs in Maple, Java and C that check criteria for a polynomial associated with a domain for the indeterminate and a possible truncation error. Examples are given with approximations to elementary functions.",

In a small enough neighbourhood of x0 one can approximate the function, however complicated, using the polynomial; the qualitative features of the latter are immediate, and polynomials are easy to handle. The expansions of the main elementary functions can be aptly combined to produce more involved expressions, in a way not dissimilar to the algebra of polynomials.",

abstract="We show that the remainder of the Taylor expansion for a holomorphic function can be written down in Lagrange form, provided that the argument of the function is sufficiently close to the interpolation point. Moreover, the value of the derivative in the remainder can be taken in the intersection of the disk whose diameter joins the interpolation point and the argument of the function and an arbitrary small angle whose bisectrix is the ray from the interpolation point through the argument of the function.",
